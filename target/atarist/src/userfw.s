; userfw.s -- user firmware module.
;
; Entry point: USERFW ($FA0800), reached from main.s either directly
; (early-boot fast path) or via the rom_function dispatcher when the
; RP issues CMD_START.
;
; Pipeline (per VBL):
;   1. Custom VBL handler at $70 (installed once at boot) wakes the
;      main loop by clearing a flag in ST RAM. We DON'T use XBIOS
;      Vsync (trap #14, #37) -- that trips through TOS's GEMDOS-aware
;      dispatch and adds latency / jitter.
;   2. Read FB_FRAME_COUNTER_ADDR ($FA400C). The RP increments this
;      after every fb_render_frame() with a memory barrier. If
;      unchanged since last iteration (D4), the FB has nothing new
;      and we skip the blit + flip entirely.
;   3. Copy the 32 KB cart framebuffer ($FA8300) into the hidden
;      ST screen page selected by A4. The copy is a pure 68000 CPU
;      MOVEM burst expanded inline via FBDRV_INLINE -- same code on
;      plain ST / STE / MegaSTE / TT / Falcon (no _MCH cookie
;      dispatch, no STE blitter path).
;   4. Flip the video base to the screen we just wrote.
;   5. Toggle A4 between SCREEN_A and SCREEN_B for the next frame.
;   6. Poll CMD_MAGIC_SENTINEL_ADDR ($FA4000). The RP-side IKBD demux
;      writes CMD_BOOT_GEM there when it decodes an ESC press. On
;      match, restore vectors / MFP / VBL / screen base and rts back
;      to the cartridge dispatcher.
;
; IRQ ownership: TOS's HBL ($68), Timer-A/B/C/D
; ($134/$120/$114/$110), and ACIA ($118) handlers are stubbed to
; single-rte dummies and their MFP IERA/IERB bits are cleared so no
; MFP source can fire. Only the custom VBL handler at $70 stays
; active.
;
; IKBD bytes are forwarded inline from FBDRV_INLINE. The MOVEM-burst
; framebuffer copy emits an IKBD poll block every FBDRV_IKBD_POLL_EVERY
; iters (~20 HBLs / 1.24 ms): btst the ACIA RX-ready bit, and if set,
; read the byte and emit it via a cart-bus read at IKBD_WINDOW_BASE +
; byte ($FB8200..$FB82FF, md-devops single-byte ABI). The RP captures
; the read via the commemul PIO+DMA ring (no per-read CPU overhead)
; and runs the IKBD demux from its main loop.

;
; Each REPT iteration emits:
;   movem.l (a6)+, d0-d7/a1-a4   ; 4 B, ~108 cycles  -- read 48 B forward
;   movem.l d0-d7/a1-a4, -(a5)   ; 4 B, ~104 cycles  -- predec store
;
; A7 (SP) and A0 are intentionally NOT in the MOVEM list:
;   - A7: keeps the supervisor SP valid so IRQs can fire safely
;     during the macro.
;   - A0: dedicated to the Timer-B audio handler's read pointer.
;     With A0 stable across the macro, the IRQ handler doesn't have
;     to save/restore it (-24 cyc/IRQ * ~125 IRQ/VBL = ~3000 cyc/VBL).
;     The inline IKBD poll uses A1 (which IS in the MOVEM list and
;     gets reloaded each iter) so it never disturbs A0.
;
; Predec mode is 4 cyc faster per iter than d16(a5) displacement
; (8+8n vs 12+8n on 68000). The catch: predec writes each 52-byte
; chunk into the destination ST page in REVERSE order relative to
; the source -- chunks land from the screen-page END (offset 31980)
; down to the START (offset 0). For the displayed image to look
; correct, the RP-side fb_chunky_to_planar pre-reverses chunks in
; the cart FB at $FA8300, so the m68k's reversal restores the
; natural image. See "Framebuffer chunk layout for the m68k MOVEM
; blit" in rp/src/include/cart_shared.h for the full spec.

;      that handler shrinks to a single `move.b (a0)+, YM_DATA.w`
;      + rte. A0 is dedicated to audio (excluded from the
;      FBDRV_INLINE MOVEM list and from the IKBD poll), so it's
;      safe to overwrite here from IRQ context.
;   2. Clear UFW_VBL_FLAG so .vbl_loop's `stop`-then-check wait can
;      distinguish a VBL wake from a Timer-B (or other MFP) wake.
;
; This replaces TOS's VBL handler entirely while userfw is running,
; so mouse / cursor-blink / keyboard-repeat / _vblqueue all stop
; firing. The ACIA IRQ ($118) is stubbed too, so GEMDOS's keyboard
; buffer is no longer filled; ESC detection runs through the inline
